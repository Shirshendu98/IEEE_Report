With the proliferation of RF communication in present era, the antenna design with scientific approach is very important criteria to meet the demand of various frequency bands. The exercise of choosing different construction in line with the Dipole, Monopole with Co-Ax feed and Horn Antenna is a scientific approach as per frequency selection and to comply its characteristics on Directivity, Gain and different parameters as per the requirements of relevant standards. The design of such antennas using HFSS has been done to extrapolate the exact characteristics of different shape of the antenna. This report is having such exercise to carry out the test and establish relevant data and evaluation of the relevant parameters through mathematical approach and software application. This design concept has been done based on application in Domestic as well as Industrial Development.
